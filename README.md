# EvoOS - Evoos

## What is EvoOs?
Evoos is a revolutionary, AI-native operating system designed for the era of adaptive computing. At its core is a hybrid micro/exo kernel that empowers applications to evolve in real-time, guided by a "DNA blueprint" that encodes hardware profiles, ML weights, and usage patterns. This blueprint enables dynamic resource partitioning—CPU cores, memory, and GPU slices are allocated on-demand based on predictive AI models, ensuring optimal performance without manual configuration. 

Independent instances run in isolated namespaces, allowing seamless alt-tab switching between GUI windows and CLI shells, while legacy shimming layers effortlessly bridge Windows, Linux, and macOS apps through intelligent syscall translation. Evoos isn't just an OS; it's a living ecosystem that mutates its own behaviors, learning from user habits to propose and implement optimizations, like automated email summaries or proactive core rebalancing, all with user consent via intuitive prompts.

Built from the ground up in Rust for safety and efficiency, Evoos starts from a UEFI seed that "blooms" into a full system, supporting distributed operation across nodes for synchronized DNA evolution. Whether for personal workflows or AI data centers, it eliminates the bloat of traditional OSes, replacing rigid hierarchies with fluid, self-optimizing growth. 

With features like fault-tolerant isolation, on-device mutation, and seamless legacy integration, Evoos represents the future of use-based computing — where the OS doesn't just serve you; it anticipates and adapts to you.
